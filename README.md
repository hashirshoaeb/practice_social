Rules:

- Attention to detail when copying Figma plans. Colours, spacing, fonts, shadows
- Take into consideration any difference between Figma dimensions and real-life dimensions
- use cubit from flutter_bloc for state management
- Clear separation of concerns (data loading vs. display)

- No UI flicker or delay when opening post view
- Use cached network image
- Use hero animation when opening post view
- Use shimmer effect for loading state
- Use scrollable widget for post list
- Prefetching strategy for media assets

- Smooth, consistent motion (no lag, no jank)
- Thoughtful easing and timing
- Modular animation structure
- Polish: transitions feel intentional, not mechanical
